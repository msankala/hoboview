A spherical panorama viewer, no strings attached, no small print in lisence.

The main purpose of this project is for me to learn programming.
Secondary goal is to make a viewer for spherical panorama images without the need to read long lisence documents and without the fear that someone someday decides to pull the rug under my feet.

This project is made possible by people working on projects like [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/), [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails/), [Leaflet](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet)
